    * Navigate to your web server's document root (e.g., `cd E:\xampp\htdocs` for XAMPP users).
    * Run the command: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git resume-builder`.
        *(Replace `your-username/your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub repository path)*

2.  **Download FPDF Library**:
    * Go to the official FPDF website: [https://www.fpdf.org/en/download.php](https://www.fpdf.org/en/download.php)
    * Download the latest version (e.g., `fpdf186.zip`).
    * Unzip the downloaded file. You'll find a folder (e.g., `fpdf186`).
    * **Rename this folder to `fpdf`**.
    * Place this `fpdf` folder directly inside your `resume-builder` project directory.
